@PRD.md @progress.txt Read the PRD and progress file. Find the next incomplete task (the first unchecked [ ] item). Skip any tasks marked LYDIA. Check if it has DEPENDS ON requirements - if so, verify those are complete in progress.txt. If the dependency is not done, skip to the next available task. Read board-reviews/synthesis.md for context, plus all relevant JS/CSS modules you will modify. Implement the task fully. Verify index.html loads without console errors. Commit with a descriptive message. Update progress.txt with what you did and the date. Mark the task [x] in PRD.md. ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK. If ALL non-LYDIA tasks in the PRD are complete, output RALPH_COMPLETE.
