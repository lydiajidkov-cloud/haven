## LIVE OPS: Phase 2 Cross-Agent Response

### Agreements

**Engineering (hardcoded content is the shared #1 priority).** Engineering's Finding #1 and #5 confirm exactly what I flagged: event modifiers are dead code, and all content lives in JS arrays with no config layer. Engineering frames this as "disconnected code that causes maintenance nightmares." From my seat it is worse -- it is an operational impossibility. I fully endorse the joint priority flag in Engineering's trade-off section. The config extraction must be sequenced: events.json first (unblocks the weekly content calendar), then daily-quests.json and pass-rewards.json. I want to co-own the spec for the config schema so it supports scheduled content (start/end dates, priority weights, segmentation tags) from day one, not just static pools.

**Game Design (event modifiers are broken -- BLOCKER).** Game Design's Finding #4 is devastating and I agree it is the single highest-priority fix. If modifiers do not work, my entire event system is decorative. Players grinding Crystal Rush for "2x gems" and getting nothing will not come back for the next event. I cannot run credible live ops on a system that lies to players. Engineering's 4-point wiring plan (board.js gem calc, spawn tier, MIN_MERGE override, energy regen) is the right scope. This must ship before any external playtest.

**Art/UX (no celebration overlay kills event milestones).** Art/UX's Finding #2 identifies a gap I did not call out explicitly but that directly undermines event engagement. Bronze/silver/gold challenge completions need a full-screen moment. The recipe-discovery-overlay pattern Art/UX references (recipes.css:397-496) is the right template. I need this for event tier completions and battle pass tier unlocks -- without it, hitting gold on an event feels identical to a regular merge.

**Marketing (push notifications are essential for event launches).** Marketing did not call this out as a standalone finding, but their viral/share gap (Finding #4) and my Finding #4 converge: we have no way to reach players outside the app. Push notifications for event starts ("Crystal Rush begins now -- 2x crystal gems all week!"), streak-at-risk warnings, and battle pass expiry are table stakes for live ops. I fully support prioritising the service worker infrastructure.

### Challenges

**Monetization's 60-70% gem income cut will gut event reward credibility.** Monetization's Finding #1 recommends halving daily login gems and removing gem rewards from chain reactions. I understand the economic argument, but event challenge rewards (50/150/400 gems at bronze/silver/gold) are the primary incentive for event participation. If free gem income drops 60-70% while event rewards stay the same, events become disproportionately the best gem source -- which sounds good until Monetization inevitably targets event rewards next. If event rewards are also cut, players have no reason to engage with weekly events at all. I need a protected floor on event reward values. **Counter-proposal:** cut ambient gem sources (merge rewards, chain reactions, worker income) as Monetization recommends, but ring-fence event and battle pass rewards at current levels. This makes events the premier free gem source, which is exactly where live ops wants player attention.

**Game Design's urgent/mega orders need calendar coordination, not ad-hoc implementation.** Game Design's Finding #2 proposes "urgent orders with countdown timers and 2x rewards" and "mega orders requiring 3 items." These are good mechanics, but if they ship as always-on systems they will collide with weekly events. An urgent order during Speed Demon (2x energy regen) trivialises the timer; a mega order during Merge Mania (min-merge = 2) becomes too easy. These must be calendar-driven, not random, so I can schedule them in event gaps or as complementary event modifiers.

### Proposed Compromises

**Economy rebalancing + event reward protection (with Monetization).** Agree to the ambient gem income cuts. In exchange, event challenge rewards and battle pass tier rewards are locked at current values for the first two seasons. After two full event rotations we review engagement data and adjust together. This gives Monetization the sink pressure they need while giving me credible event incentives.

**Urgent/mega orders as live-ops-scheduled content (with Game Design).** Add urgent and mega orders to the config-driven content system rather than as always-on features. I schedule them via the content calendar -- "Mega Order Monday" during off-event days, urgent orders as mid-week engagement spikes. Game Design owns the mechanic design; live ops owns the scheduling. This prevents event/order collisions and adds another lever to the content calendar.

**Celebration overlay shared across events + milestones (with Art/UX).** Build one configurable celebration overlay system that serves event tier completions, creature discoveries, battle pass unlocks, and max-tier merges. Art/UX designs it once; live ops configures per-event theming (colours, creature showcase, reward breakdown) through the content config. This is more efficient than separate overlays per system and ensures visual consistency.

**Push notification triggers co-owned with Marketing.** Engineering builds the service worker. Marketing and live ops jointly define the trigger catalogue: event start/end, streak at risk, battle pass expiry, energy full, worker earnings threshold. Marketing owns copy and A/B testing; live ops owns scheduling and frequency caps. Neither team sends notifications without the other's sign-off.
