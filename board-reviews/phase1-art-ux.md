## HEAD OF ART/UX: Haven Review

### Executive Summary (3 sentences max)
Haven delivers surprisingly premium visual polish for a vanilla JS merge game -- the tile system, animation library, and procedural audio are best-in-class for this tech stack. The biggest strength is the layered "juice" system where every interaction cascades through particles, sound, haptics, and CSS animation simultaneously. The biggest risk is emoji-based art: without custom sprite assets, store screenshots will look amateur next to Merge Dragons and Travel Town, capping conversion rates regardless of gameplay quality.

### Dimension Scores
| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Visual coherence & style consistency | 3.5/5 | Consistent dark palette via CSS custom properties (style.css:3-17), unified card gradients across all 12 CSS files (e.g. `linear-gradient(145deg, #1e3048, #152436)` in achievements.css:64, events.css:139, recipes.css:65, welcome.css:29). Chain identity system with distinct border-radius silhouettes per chain (tiles.css:47,72,111,133,189) creates genuine visual language. Deducted for emoji-as-art limiting perceivable quality ceiling. |
| "Juice" factor | 4.5/5 | 30+ keyframe animations in animations.css covering every interaction state. Merge celebration is a 4-layer feedback sandwich: CSS merge-flash (animations.css:48-73) + merge-result-pop (animations.css:80-106) + canvas particle burst (particles.js:46-61) + material-specific procedural audio (audio.js:174-224) + haptic vibration (board.js:800). Combo system escalates through 5 color tiers with milestone text, edge glow, and screen shake (combo.css:62-66, combo.js:214-235). Surge mode adds animated gradient bar + board glow pulse (style.css:460-496, animations.css:470-490). Musical merge streaks play Ode to Joy (audio.js:96-114). Idle bob animation on all items (animations.css:154-169). High-tier items get progressive glow, shimmer, and legendary rainbow borders (tiles.css:548-823). |
| UX clarity & information hierarchy | 3.5/5 | Board-hint text guides first interaction (index.html:48-49), auto-hides after 3 spawns (index.html:276-282). Tutorial has spotlight system with box-shadow cutout technique (style.css:733-738), tooltip arrows (tutorial.css:107-128), and skip button (tutorial.css:132-151). Valid merge targets pulse gold (animations.css:607-621), cross-chain targets pulse purple (animations.css:883-897). Near-miss system highlights "almost" matches (style.css:522-530, board.js:716-729). Order delivery targets get dedicated pulse (animations.css:520-550). Deducted for: orders panel uses 11px font (style.css:1056) risking readability; tier dots are 3px (style.css:278) -- nearly invisible on mobile; 8-9px labels throughout daily calendar (daily.css:72,91,198) push legibility limits. |
| Mobile-first design | 4/5 | Viewport meta prevents zoom (index.html:5). Safe area insets for notched phones on top bar and bottom nav (style.css:68,372). Touch-action manipulation prevents browser gestures (style.css:46,180). Pull-to-refresh blocked (index.html:449-453). Context menu prevented (index.html:456-458). Pointer events with single-finger locking (board.js:152-154). Cell size uses responsive `min(14vw, 8vh, 58px)` (style.css:19). Three responsive breakpoints at 750px, 600px, 320px. Webkit tap highlight removed (style.css:31). Swipe-merge supports undo by reversing finger (board.js:257-263). Power-up buttons at 38px (style.css:585) -- adequate but tight for touch. Deducted for: resource node labels at 9px (style.css:359) with no minimum touch-target height enforcement; companion slots at 40px (style.css:1152) borderline for Apple's 44pt recommendation; calendar boxes at min-height 70px on 320px screens (daily.css:279) but claim button inside is only 8px font with 2px padding (daily.css:293-294). |
| Store/marketing screenshot potential | 2/5 | The fundamental blocker: all game art is emoji (index.html:29,36,73-91). Emojis render differently per OS/browser, destroying visual consistency on screenshots. No custom splash screen, logo treatment, or promotional art assets. The dark UI looks sleek in isolation but merge game audiences expect colorful, bright, whimsical art. Competitor comparison: Merge Dragons has hand-painted dragons; Merge Mansion has illustrated characters; Travel Town has custom 3D-style items. Haven's emoji tiles will read as "prototype" in the App Store. The CSS tile styling (tiles.css) is impressively detailed but polishes a fundamentally non-marketable art foundation. Gradient backgrounds, glow halos, and rainbow borders cannot substitute for illustrated art assets. |

### Critical Findings

1. **[BLOCKER] Emoji Art Ceiling**: All items, resource nodes, creatures, and UI icons use system emoji (index.html:29,36,73-91; board.js:1303-1305 renders `def.symbol` as text). Emoji rendering varies across iOS, Android, Samsung, and desktop browsers. A Crystal Shard looks completely different on iOS vs Samsung.
   - Impact: Store conversion rate will be 50-70% below category benchmarks. Players scrolling the store will perceive Haven as a student project. No amount of CSS polish compensates for this in screenshots.
   - Recommendation: Commission custom SVG or WebP sprite sheets for all 5 chains x 10 tiers (50 base items + 4 hybrid chains). Estimate: 2-3 weeks for a single illustrator, or use AI-assisted asset generation pipeline. This is the single highest-ROI investment for the project.

2. **[BLOCKER] No Merge Celebration "Moment"**: While individual merge feedback is excellent (flash + pop + particles + sound), there is no full-screen celebration for milestone merges (first tier-5, first creature hatch, max tier). The `playCelebration()` function (audio.js:331-340) triggers but has no corresponding visual celebration overlay. Compare to Merge Dragons' dragon discovery screen or Travel Town's item-unlock cinematic.
   - Impact: Players miss the dopamine peak that drives social sharing and session extension. High-tier merges feel "good" but not "shareable."
   - Recommendation: Add a full-screen celebration overlay for tier 5+, creature discoveries, and first hybrid unlocks. Scale: confetti particles, item showcase with zoom, "+10 gems" counter animation. Estimate: 3-5 days. The `recipe-discovery-overlay` pattern (recipes.css:397-496) already exists and can be adapted.

3. **[RISK] Micro-Text Legibility**: Multiple UI elements use 8-9px fonts: daily calendar day labels (daily.css:72: `font-size: 8px`), calendar reward labels (daily.css:91: `font-size: 8px`), tier dots at 3px diameter (style.css:278), order requirement text at 11px (style.css:1056), clutter warning at 9px (style.css:316), powerup cost at 8px (style.css:647). On a 5.5" phone at arm's length, 8px text is functionally invisible.
   - Impact: Players over 35 (core casual audience) will struggle with calendar rewards, order requirements, and system warnings. Accessibility compliance risk.
   - Recommendation: Establish 11px minimum for all interactive text, 10px minimum for decorative labels. Increase tier dots to 4-5px. Calendar boxes can use icon-only instead of text labels at narrow widths. Estimate: 1-2 days.

4. **[RISK] Animation Performance on Low-End Devices**: tiles.css contains per-chain, per-tier box-shadow animations (tiles.css:480-545) with up to 6 layered box-shadows animating simultaneously. Legendary items add `conic-gradient` rainbow border (tiles.css:753-765) + sparkle particles via `::after` box-shadows (tiles.css:794-814) + halo shimmer via `::before` (tiles.css:567-577). A board with multiple tier 6+ items could have 20+ simultaneous CSS animations with complex box-shadows.
   - Impact: Frame drops on budget Android devices (which dominate casual game demographics). The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query (animations.css:904-912) helps accessibility but doesn't address performance on devices that don't set this flag.
   - Recommendation: Add a "Performance Mode" setting that caps animations to tier-4 and below, replaces box-shadow pulse with opacity-only pulse, and disables `::before`/`::after` pseudo-element decorations. Estimate: 2 days. Also consider using `will-change` more strategically -- currently applied to 4 selectors in animations.css but not on the heavy tier-pulse keyframes in tiles.css.

5. **[OPPORTUNITY] Procedural Audio Is a Hidden Gem**: The audio system (audio.js) is remarkably sophisticated -- material-specific merge sounds for all 5 chains (audio.js:188-214), an Ode to Joy melody that emerges from merge streaks (audio.js:96-172), escalating harmonic layers at streak milestones (audio.js:560-606), and 20+ distinct sound events covering every interaction. This is competitive with or better than commercial merge game audio. However, there is no background music or ambient audio.
   - Impact: The audio design creates genuine emotional moments but players in silent mode (the majority on mobile) miss it entirely. No ambient sound means silence between interactions, which feels empty.
   - Recommendation: Add a subtle ambient loop (procedurally generated from the same Web Audio API) with gentle nature sounds matching the "Haven" theme. Add a visual "music note" indicator when streak melodies are playing to encourage sound-on play. Estimate: 2-3 days.

6. **[OPPORTUNITY] Swipe-Merge Is Under-Signposted**: The swipe-merge system (board.js:490-580) is a differentiating feature -- players can draw a path through adjacent matching tiles to merge them all at once. The visual connector lines (board.js:541-567) and swipe-active cell highlighting (style.css:216-224, animations.css:763-774) work well. But there is no discovery mechanism beyond the tutorial.
   - Impact: Most casual players will never discover swipe-merge, missing the most satisfying interaction pattern. Competitors like Travel Town have made swipe-merge a core identity.
   - Recommendation: Add a periodic "Did you know?" toast after the player has completed 20+ tap-merges without ever swiping. Add a subtle visual trail effect (CSS gradient or canvas line) that previews the merge path before finger-up. Estimate: 1-2 days.

7. **[OPPORTUNITY] Welcome-Back Screen Is Well-Crafted**: The welcome overlay (welcome.css) has staggered creature bob animations with `nth-child` delays (welcome.css:128-134), count-up number animation potential, and a strong CTA button. The card entrance uses elastic bezier curve (welcome.css:41). This is one of the most polished sub-screens.
   - Impact: Good return-session experience drives D7 retention.
   - Recommendation: No changes needed. Consider adding a "streak" multiplier for consecutive daily returns to pair with the daily login calendar.

8. **[RISK] No Visual Distinction Between Tap, Drag, and Swipe Modes**: The board supports three interaction models (board.js:106-348): tap-to-select, drag-and-drop, and swipe-merge. But the cursor/finger feedback doesn't differentiate them. Selected items get a gold pulse (animations.css:176-207), drag shows a ghost clone (animations.css:214-227), and swipe highlights cells (animations.css:763-774) -- but there is no affordance telling players which mode they are in or when mode-switching occurs.
   - Impact: Players accidentally trigger drags when they meant to tap, or miss swipe opportunities. The 12px drag threshold (board.js:45) helps but is a band-aid.
   - Recommendation: Add a brief "mode indicator" tooltip that appears during the first 5 drags and first 5 swipes: "Drag to move!" and "Swipe to chain-merge!" Estimate: 1 day.

### Trade-off Flags
- The emoji-to-custom-art migration (Finding #1) requires engineering changes in `board.js:renderCell()` (line 1280-1328) and `Items.js` -- the Art/UX team needs Engineering lead buy-in before asset production begins.
- Performance mode (Finding #4) may conflict with the Game Design lead's vision for high-tier items as aspirational rewards -- reducing their visual fidelity diminishes the "collect them all" motivation.
- Adding background ambient audio (Finding #5) will increase the audio module's CPU footprint, which may conflict with performance goals on low-end devices. The two recommendations (ambient audio + performance mode) should ship together.

### Go/No-Go Signal
**AMBER** -- Haven's interaction design, animation system, and audio are genuinely best-in-class for a vanilla JS casual game. The juice factor alone demonstrates deep understanding of what makes merge games feel satisfying. However, the emoji art foundation is a hard blocker for store marketability. The game will feel wonderful to play but will struggle to acquire players through visual-first discovery channels (App Store browse, social ads, YouTube thumbnails).
