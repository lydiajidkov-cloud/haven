# Haven - Monetization & Value Analysis Report

**Agent:** F2P Monetization Specialist
**Date:** 2026-02-11

---

## Overall Grade: C+ (functional but undermonetized — leaving 60-70% of revenue on the table)

## IAP Pricing

| Tier | Price | Gems | Gems/$ | Bonus |
|------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Gem Pouch | $0.99 | 100 | 101/$ | Baseline |
| Gem Chest | $4.99 | 550 | 110/$ | +10% |
| Gem Vault | $9.99 | 1,350 | 135/$ | +35% |
| Gem Treasury | $19.99 | 3,500 | 175/$ | +75% |

Scaling is competitive (50-80% bonus at top tier = industry standard).
**Missing:** $49.99 and $99.99 whale tiers.

## Best & Worst Deals

### Best Deals:
1. **Power Pack** (120 gems for 12 power-ups = 10 gems each) — 50% discount vs individual
2. **Starter Pack** ($1.99 for ~$7 value = 3.5x multiplier) — killer conversion offer
3. **Piggy Bank** at 250+ merges ($2.99 = 500+ gems = 166+ gems/$) — best value if patient

### Trap Items:
1. **Common Egg** (50 gems for tier 0 item) — same as free spawn
2. **Full Recharge** (35 gems) — terrible unless energy is near 0
3. **Epic Egg** (400 gems) — too expensive for one item

## Battle Pass Value

| Track | Total Value | Cost | ROI |
|-------|-------------|------|-----|
| Free | ~$5-6 (507 gems + energy + stars + power-ups) | Free | N/A |
| Premium | ~$25-30 (2,325 gems + eggs + power-ups) | $7.99 | 3-4x |

**Problem:** Completable in 8-16 days — too fast. Should be 30+ days.

## Piggy Bank Analysis

- Accumulates 1-3 gems per merge (avg 2)
- Break-even vs $0.99 bundle: ~150 merges
- Better than ALL bundles at 250+ merges
- **Brilliant retention mechanic** — Homescapes-proven pattern

## F2P Monthly Income: ~4,032 gems ($36 equivalent)
- Daily Login: 1,050 gems
- Daily Quests: 1,350 gems
- Battle Pass Free: 507 gems
- Ads (5/day): 1,125 gems

**Problem:** F2P is too comfortable. Low conversion pressure.

## Spending Pressure Points

| Moment | Pressure | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Energy empty | HIGH | Interrupts flow — monetization moment |
| Board full | MEDIUM | Player-caused, power-up opportunity |
| Collection incomplete | LOW | Luxury spending, no urgency |
| Piggy bank visible | MEDIUM | Builds over time |
| Battle Pass expiring | MISSING | No season timer shown |

**No soft paywall exists.** Everything is achievable F2P.

## Missing Monetization (vs Market Standards)

## Top 10 Revenue Recommendations

2. **Add streak insurance** ($0.99 to save broken login streak)
3. **Daily flash sale** — 1 rotating item at 30% off
4. **Extend battle pass to 30 days** — increase premium conversion
5. **Cap piggy bank at 500 gems** — force conversion
6. **Add VIP subscription** ($4.99/mo: 200 gems/day, 50% faster energy)
7. **Add weekend events** — 48hr challenges with exclusive rewards
8. **Add energy-empty popup** — direct purchase prompt when energy hits 0
9. **Add whale tiers** ($49.99 = 10,000 gems, $99.99 = 25,000 gems)
10. **Add battle pass teaser** — show premium rewards when claiming free track

## Conversion Funnel Recommendations

- **Energy empty:** Show purchase popup (not just shop link)
- **Board full:** "Try Sort & Sweep?" → direct power-up purchase
- **Gem shortage:** "Need 10 more gems — $0.99 for 100?" when 10 short
- **First purchase bonus:** ANY first buy unlocks permanent +10% gem income
- **Comeback rewards:** 100 gems + 50 energy after 7+ days away
