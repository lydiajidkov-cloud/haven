## Key Finding: Economy is BROKEN — gem inflation by Day 10

### Gem Income (Monthly)
| Source | Gems/Month |
|--------|-----------|
| Daily Login | 1,340 |
| Battle Pass Free | 1,690 |
| Daily Quests | 1,350 |
| Island Nodes | 1,213 |
| Active Play (merges/chains) | ~1,500 |
| Ads (30/month) | 225 |
| Main Quests | ~400 |
| **TOTAL** | **~7,718** |

### Gem Sinks
| Category | Cost to "Complete" |
|----------|-------------------|
| All Biome Eggs | 760 |
| 10 Power-Up Packs | 1,200 |
| 20 Energy Refills | 700 |
| 5 Epic Eggs | 2,000 |
| **Total** | **~4,660** |

**Result:** Players accumulate ~3,000 surplus gems/month with nothing to spend on.

### Critical Issues

1. **Energy refill ROI is broken** — spending 35 gems on 100 energy yields ~70 gems in merge rewards (2x return). Energy refills should NEVER be net-positive.

2. **Daily login too generous** — 1,340 gems/month for just opening the app equals ~10 min of active play, for free.

3. **Battle Pass free track too generous** — 1,690 gems total. Premium track (2,500) should be 3x more valuable, not 1.5x.

4. **Players hit 1,000+ gem balance by Day 10** before spending habits form.

### 30-Minute Session Simulation
- 100 energy = 100 spawns = ~60 merges
- High-tier merges: +26 gems
- Surge bonuses: +48 gems
- Chain reactions: +22 gems
- Lucky merges: +10 gems
- Quest completion: +25 gems
- **Total: ~131 gems in 30 min** (excluding pass)

### Recommendations

1. **Reduce daily login gems 40%** (1,340 → 800/month)
2. **Cap Battle Pass free track at 800 gems** (from 1,690)
3. **Increase energy refill cost to 75 gems** or remove +1 gem during surge
4. **Alternate quest rewards** — some give ONLY stars, some ONLY gems
5. **Reduce early island node gems 50%** (first 15 nodes: 500 → 250)
6. **Power Pack price increase** to 200 gems (from 120) — it's too good
7. **Add gem dump prestige system** — 500 gem weekly spend for cosmetics/legendary eggs
8. **Reduce ad rewards** to 3-5 gems (from 5-10)

### Revised Economy Target
| Source | Current | Proposed | Change |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| Daily Login | 1,340 | 800 | -40% |
| Battle Pass Free | 1,690 | 800 | -53% |
| Daily Quests | 1,350 | 700 | -48% |
| Island Nodes | 1,213 | 600 | -51% |
| Active Play | ~1,500 | ~1,200 | -20% |
| **TOTAL** | **~7,718** | **~4,420** | **-43%** |

This creates healthy tension where players must prioritize spending rather than buying everything.
